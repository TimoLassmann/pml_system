* Primordial Particle System

Welcome to my C implementation of the [[https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969][Primordial Particle System (PPS)]] by Thomas Schmickl & Martin Stefanec using [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases][Raylib]]! Please note that this is an experimental project and might have its quirks, but I hope you find it as intriguing and fun to play with as I did while developing it.

Schmickl, T., Stefanec, M. & Crailsheim, K.
[How a life-like system emerges from a simplistic particle motion law.](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969)
Sci Rep 6, 37969 (2016).

** Installation

Install [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases][raylib]] first, then:

#+begin_src bash :eval never 
git clone https://github.com/timolassmann/pml_system.git
cd pml_system
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
#+end_src

The compiled program is placed in `build/bin/`.

** Usage

The command line interface accepts the following options:

#+begin_src bash :eval never 
Usage: pml_system

Options:

   -a/--alpha         : Alpha parameter. [180]
   -b/--beta          : Beta parameter. [17]
   -d/--density       : Inital particle density. [0.07]

#+end_src

To run with default parameters simply:

#+begin_src bash :eval never 
$ ./pml_system 
#+end_src

In 'game' use the:
- left and right arrow keys to slow down / speed up the simulation
- space to pause
- and esc to quit.
